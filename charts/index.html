			<h2><a href="power-area/power-area.html">Area chart</a></h2>
			<p>An area chart to show power over time for one or more groups of data streams stacked together. 
			The chart supports a traditional mode and a <em>wiggle</em> mode that can help visualize the 
			relative changes of many data streams.
			<p>This is useful for answering questions like:</p>
			<ul class="q">
				<li>How can I quickly understand when I am using or generating power?</li>
			</ul>

			<h2><a href="power-area/power-area-overlap.html">Area overlap chart</a></h2>
			<p>An area chart to show power over time for one or more groups of data streams. All groups
			share a common y-axis and are presented layered on top of each other.
			<p>This is useful for answering questions like:</p>
			<ul class="q">

			<h2><a href="power-io/power-io.html">Area I/O chart</a></h2>
			<p>An area chart to show energy per hour, day, or month for two groups of data streams. It is similar to the

			negative values on the y-axis, and the difference between the groups can be shown as a line on top.

			<p>A bar chart to show energy per hour, day, or month for one or more groups of data streams.

			For a single group this is useful for answering questions like:</p>

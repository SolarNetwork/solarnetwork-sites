			<h2><a name="power-area" href="power-area/power-area.html">Area chart</a></h2>
			<p>An area chart to show power over time for one or more groups of data streams stacked together. 
			The chart supports a traditional mode and a <em>wiggle</em> mode that can help visualize the 
			relative changes of many data streams.
			<p>This is useful for answering questions like:</p>
			<ul class="q">
				<li>How can I quickly understand when I am using or generating power?</li>
